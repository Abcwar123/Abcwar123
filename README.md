I have a great personality in some ways but in others its kind sour in my opinion. A big reason to me in why its sour is because I have a bit of a diffucult time
sticking to things that are difficult and I don't like to show others that I am struggling so I'd rather not do something if it has to vbe revieled to tohers, 
and I think that's pretty sour.
So that is definately something I want to improve. I think I xan do it if I rerally put my mind to it. So just silently wish me luck please. I know my wife will be.

So I was able to make ^^ disappear but in a new branch I used the same < ! - - - ... - - - > and the content stayed in white lettering rather then turning gray and therefore readable.
